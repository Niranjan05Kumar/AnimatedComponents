# 🚀 ShadCN UI Component Practice – React + Tailwind CSS

This project is a **component practice playground** built with **React**, **JavaScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**, where I integrated and explored various components from **ShadCN UI**. It serves as a hands-on implementation to understand how ShadCN UI works in a Vite + React environment and how to use it to create clean, responsive, and accessible UI elements.
